Hey Bill,

     I'm going to be direct with you, are you ok? 
Management has alerted me that you have been not showing up to the office and when you do you are mildly intoxicated. 
This kind of behavior is not professional and out of character for you, this leads me to think you might be dealing with something outside of work. 
Lets get together in person to discuss what's going on and if/how I can help.

Warm Regards, Alex
