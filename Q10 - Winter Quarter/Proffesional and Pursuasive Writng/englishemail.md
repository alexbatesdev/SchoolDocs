Hello Professor Carter!

I am enrolled in your class and I just wanted to introduce myself and what I look forward to in the class.
You'll find me in the system as Michael Bates, but I go by Alex. My current hobbie is drawing in an animation program on the Nintendo 3DS! The limitations of 3 layers, 2 colors per layer, and the super low resolution are a fun challenge and really make it easier to be creative because of that whole "limitation breeds creativity" thing.
As for what I'm looking forward to in this class, I'm excited to spiff up my resume, learn how to write a cover letter, and I'm especially excited for the project proposal assignment because I have a fun app idea I want to flesh out!
