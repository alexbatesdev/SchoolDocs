# Neumont College of Computer Science Coursework Repository
Welcome to my GitHub repository containing all of my coursework from my time at Neumont College of Computer Science. This collection includes various projects, assignments, and homework that I've completed throughout my academic journey.

# Disclaimer
This repository is intended for educational purposes only. It serves as a personal archive of my learning process and showcases the skills I've developed at Neumont.

# For Neumont Students
I encourage fellow Neumont students to use these materials as a learning aid. Please use the code and projects here to understand the concepts and problem-solving techniques better. Copying and pasting won't help you learn or growâ€”it's your understanding that will make you a competent professional.

# Note on Academic Integrity
I understand the temptation to find quick solutions in a high-pressure academic environment. However, I urge you to respect the principles of academic integrity. This repository should serve as an inspiration or a study guide, not a shortcut to completing your assignments.
