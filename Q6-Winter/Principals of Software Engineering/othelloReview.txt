1. Kanban is agile at its most simple. What is there to do? What are we doing? What is done?
 - The most important thing is to not have a bunch of "doing" items, otherwise that means there may be a productivity blockage

2. The project went alright, I think we should have been able to do more, but I'm pretty proud of what we got

3. I really like how informal it is, you can kinda just get to work right away as long as you take a minute to set up the trello
A downside is that someone can kinda just do nothing without much social pressure due to meetings.
Usually people want at least a little progress between scrum meetings, but with kanban there's less of this pressure.
